## Overview

MedCore is a hospital information system built as a TypeScript monorepo. It spans outpatient and inpatient care, emergency, surgery, pharmacy, lab, blood bank, billing with GST and Razorpay, HR and payroll, patient engagement, and a React Native patient app. The web dashboard, API, and mobile app share validation schemas and types end to end.

The project is under active development. A live demo instance runs at **[medcore.globusdemos.com](https://medcore.globusdemos.com)** and is exercised by the Playwright E2E suite on every push.

## Feature Catalog

### AI Features

- **AI Triage Chatbot** (`/dashboard/ai-booking`) — multi-turn symptom collection chat supporting English and Hindi. Deterministic red-flag detection (cardiac, stroke, respiratory, bleeding, suicidal ideation, obstetric, neonatal, Hindi phrases) fires before the LLM, triggering an immediate emergency screen with call-112 instructions. After 4+ exchanges Claude assesses the complaint, recommends specialties and matching doctors, and lets the patient book an appointment without leaving the chat.
- **AI Scribe** (`/dashboard/scribe`) — ambient speech-to-text during consultation. Transcripts stream to the API every 5 final utterances; once 3+ entries accumulate, Claude generates a structured SOAP draft (Subjective / Objective / Assessment / Plan) with ICD-10 code suggestions and confidence scores. The doctor edits any field inline, then signs off — at which point the note is written directly to the EHR consultation record.
- **Drug Safety Check** — runs automatically inside the Scribe transcript endpoint every time a new SOAP draft is produced. Two-layer architecture: a fast deterministic layer checks ~15 curated high-risk pairs (warfarin + NSAIDs/azithromycin/metronidazole, SSRI + MAOI, sildenafil + nitrates, clopidogrel + omeprazole, methotrexate + NSAIDs, etc.), allergy cross-reactivity families (penicillin, sulfa, NSAIDs, codeine), and condition contraindications (asthma + beta-blockers, CKD + NSAIDs/metformin, pregnancy + warfarin/NSAIDs/tetracyclines). The LLM layer then catches anything not in the curated list. Alerts are severity-coded CONTRAINDICATED → SEVERE → MODERATE → MILD. A `DrugAlertBanner` in the Scribe UI blocks sign-off on CONTRAINDICATED alerts until the doctor explicitly acknowledges clinical responsibility.

### Clinical

- **OPD** — appointments, walk-in queue with token generation (DB unique constraint, race-tested), live queue updates over Socket.IO, vulnerability flagging for at-risk patients.
- **Prescriptions** — drug interaction checks, renal dose calculator, scannable QR codes (real PNG generated with `qrcode`, decodable via `jsqr`), public `/verify/rx/[id]` verification page, PDF export via pdfkit.
- **Lab** — multi-test orders, result entry, delta flag against previous values, CRITICAL panic-value alerts, QC with Levey-Jennings charts, TAT tracking.
- **Admissions / IPD** — ward and bed management, nurse MAR, isolation, bed occupancy, discharge summary PDF.
- **Emergency** — 5-level triage, MEWS/GCS/RTS scoring, live ER board via `ER:update` Socket.IO events, MLC tracking.
- **Surgery / OT** — pre-op checklist enforced server-side, intra-op timing, PACU, SSI tracking, OT calendar.
- **Maternity & Pediatrics** — antenatal workflow with ACOG risk scoring and SVG partograph, pediatric growth charts, India UIP immunization schedule.
- **Blood Bank** — donor registry, ABO/Rh matching, component separation, unit reservations.
- **Ambulance** — dispatch with status transitions, fleet and fuel logs.
- **Telemedicine** — Jitsi video sessions with in-call chat and prescription creation.

### Operations

- **Inventory** — reorder thresholds with scheduled auto-PO generation.
- **Purchase orders** — approve/receive workflow, partial GRN, three-way match.
- **Suppliers** — contracts, GST details, performance tracking.
- **Assets** — depreciation, calibration, warranty alerts, QR tags, dispose workflow.
- **Visitor management** — check-in with a 2-per-patient cap, printable passes, blacklist.
- **Health packages** — preventive bundles with validity and family sharing.

### Finance

- **GST-aware invoicing** with CGST + SGST split, amount-in-words, PDF via pdfkit.
- **Razorpay integration** — server-side `verifyPayment` (fail-closed in production) plus a real webhook handler at `POST /api/v1/billing/razorpay-webhook` with HMAC-SHA256 raw-body verification, idempotency via `Payment.transactionId @unique`, and amount cross-check against the Razorpay REST API.
- **Insurance / TPA** — pre-authorization and claim workflow.
- **Refunds, credit notes, discounts** (flat / percentage) with threshold-based approvals.
- **Expenses and budgets** with category tracking and monthly variance.

### HR and People

- **Shift roster** grouped by morning / afternoon / night.
- **Leaves** — balance tracking, approval workflow, 6 leave types, calendar view.
- **Payroll** — basic + allowances + overtime with approval and pay-slip generation.
- **Seven roles** — `ADMIN`, `DOCTOR`, `NURSE`, `RECEPTION`, `PATIENT`, `PHARMACIST`, `LAB_TECH`. A permissions matrix test exercises **178 role/endpoint assertions**.
- **Certifications and holiday calendar** (Indian public holidays template).

### Patient Engagement

- **Feedback** with 5-star ratings, NPS, sentiment analysis.
- **Complaints** with SLA due-at calculation and escalation.
- **Internal chat** over Socket.IO with reactions, pinning, mentions, department channels.
- **Notifications** — 13 notification types × 4 channels (WhatsApp / SMS / Email / Push) with templated messages, quiet-hours defer, `drainScheduled` cron that picks up both scheduled and NULL `scheduledFor` rows, and retry-once on failure.

### Mobile (React Native + Expo SDK 53)

- **Patient app** — appointments, live queue over Socket.IO, prescription viewer, billing tab with native Razorpay checkout or WebView fallback, push notifications via `expo-notifications`.
- **Doctor-lite app** — workspace, patients, prescriptions.
- 401 refresh interceptor, env-driven API URL via `expo-constants`, EAS build profiles for dev/preview/production.

### Security

- **Persistent auth state** — 2FA temp tokens and password-reset codes are stored in the database, not in-memory maps, so they survive restarts.
- **TOTP 2FA** implemented with pure Node `crypto` (no external library).
- **Refresh-token rotation** with replay detection; JWTs include `jti` to avoid same-second collisions.
- **File uploads** — row-level ACL, HMAC-signed URLs, magic-byte MIME sniffing that rejects an executable renamed to `.jpg`, 10 MB cap.
- **Audit log** on every mutation with CSV export.
- **Rate limits** — 600 req/min global, 30 req/min on auth endpoints.

### Accessibility and i18n

- WCAG 2.1 AA baseline; axe-core CI gate with per-page budget overrides. Hard-fails on `button-name`, `select-name`, `label`, and `image-alt`.
- English and Hindi translations across **374 keys** covering 10 dashboard pages. `<html lang>` switches reactively.

### PDF Generation

Server-side PDFs via pdfkit for prescriptions (with embedded PNG QR), invoices (GST breakdown, amount-in-words), and discharge summaries. Routes branch on `?format=pdf` so the HTML print flow still works for backward compatibility.

## Architecture

```
medcore/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          Express API — routers, services, Socket.IO gateway
│   ├── web/          Next.js 15 dashboard (App Router, React 19)
│   └── mobile/       React Native (Expo) patient and doctor-lite apps

└── docs/             PRD, architecture notes, 68 Playwright screenshots
```

### Key decisions

- **End-to-end type safety.** The same Zod schemas validate API requests and generate TypeScript types consumed by the web and mobile apps.
- **Prisma-first data modeling.** Production uses `prisma migrate deploy` — no more `db push`. Four migrations applied to prod: initial, auth persistence tables, PHARMACIST/LAB_TECH roles, razorpay + push-token drift.
- **Socket.IO for realtime.** Live OPD queue, ER board, chat, admissions.
- **Fail-closed payments.** Razorpay signature mismatch returns 400 in production; webhooks use raw-body verification and idempotency on `Payment.transactionId`.
- **Row-level file ACLs** with HMAC-signed URLs and magic-byte sniffing.

## Testing

MedCore layers its tests so each tier tests a different boundary:

| Layer | Count | What it covers |
|---|---:|---|
| **Unit** | 350 | Helpers, validators, utilities, notification channel adapters, red-flag detection (41 cases) |
| **Contract** | 121 | Zod request/response schemas between API and web |
| **Smoke** | 30 | Fast sanity pass across critical routes |
| **Web** | 151 | React component and page-level tests |
| **Integration** | 763 | Full HTTP through Express + Prisma against a real Postgres. Includes concurrency, realtime delivery, permissions matrix (178 assertions), auth edges, 2FA, notification channel shapes, Razorpay webhook, AI triage (16), AI scribe (15) |
| **Total** | **1,415** | |

In addition:

- **29 Playwright E2E tests** hit the live demo URL on every push (1 gated behind `E2E_FULL`).
- **12 axe-core accessibility tests** with per-page color-contrast budgets.

### Running tests locally

```bash
# API test tiers
npm --prefix apps/api run test:unit
npm --prefix apps/api run test:contract
npm --prefix apps/api run test:smoke
npm --prefix apps/api run test:integration   # requires Postgres

# Web tests
npm --prefix apps/web run test

# Playwright E2E (against local or live URL)
npx playwright test
E2E_FULL=1 npx playwright test               # include the gated spec
```

GitHub Actions runs four workflows on every push: typecheck, API tests with a Postgres service container, web tests, and Playwright E2E.

## Deployment

Production runs on a single Ubuntu 22.04 host behind nginx with Let's Encrypt:

```
nginx (443)
  ├─ medcore.globusdemos.com    → Next.js (:3200)
  └─ /api                        → Express API (:4100)
                                    └─ Docker PostgreSQL (:5433)

PM2: medcore-api, medcore-web (systemd auto-restart)
Cron: daily pg_dump @ 02:00 + health check every 5 min
```

### `scripts/deploy.sh`

The deploy script ships code, runs `prisma migrate deploy`, restarts PM2, and runs a post-deploy health check. Seeding production is **gated behind an explicit opt-in**:

```bash
# Dangerous — only for a fresh environment. Wipes the database.
ALLOW_PROD_SEED_RESET=YES_I_WILL_WIPE_THE_HOSPITAL ./scripts/deploy.sh --seed
```

Without the exact magic string the script refuses to seed.

### Backups

Daily gzipped `pg_dump` with 30-day retention. Restore rehearsal has been verified — 8 sampled tables match the source dump byte-for-byte.

---

## Accessibility

- Axe-core CI gate with per-page color-contrast budgets.
- 12 passing a11y specs across key dashboard pages.
- Hard-fails on `button-name`, `select-name`, `label`, and `image-alt` rules.
- 20+ `aria-label`s added to icon-only controls.

---

## Internationalization

- English and Hindi across 374 translation keys.
- 10 dashboard pages wired to `useTranslation`.
- `<html lang>` switches reactively with the active locale.
- A dev-only `I18N.md` documents the "add both languages in the same PR" rule.

---

## Known Follow-ups

This is an honest list. Nothing below is hidden in a marketing footnote.

- HIPAA / ABDM compliance has **not** been third-party audited. The codebase implements relevant controls (audit log, signed URLs, encryption at rest via Postgres) but the certifications are not in place.
- HL7 / FHIR export is planned, not built.
- Multi-tenant / multi-branch is roadmap.
- The mobile doctor-lite app is intentionally a subset of the web workspace.

---

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide, including the **Prisma migration policy** — all schema changes must ship as a `prisma migrate dev` migration file. `prisma db push` is not permitted against any shared environment.

Quick path:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
npx tsc --noEmit -p apps/api/tsconfig.json
npx tsc --noEmit -p apps/web/tsconfig.json
npm --prefix apps/api run test:unit
git commit -m "feat: add awesome thing"
git push origin feat/your-feature
```

Standards:

- TypeScript strict mode, Zod at every API boundary.
- Audit logging on every mutation.
- Tailwind utilities; avoid new CSS files.
- No new runtime npm dependencies without discussion.
- Both English and Hindi keys added for any user-facing string.
